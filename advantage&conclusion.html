<h1>Benefits of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
<h3>By replacing repetitive tasks with automated mechanisms and processes, one of the benefits of artificial intelligence is its ability to improve efficiencies and increase productivity. Of course, observers of the various artificial intelligence pros and cons might argue that this same benefit has a darker side, in that the people who were formerly responsible for performing these repetitive tasks could lose their jobs.</h3>
<p>However, one of the advantages of artificial intelligence that’s often overlooked in this argument is the potential it holds for job creation. While it’s possible that AI will eliminate low-skilled jobs, emerging technologies in the field may equally create high-skilled job opportunities that will span all sectors of the economy. We’re already witnessing this to some extent, with the growing demand for professionals with AI and related skills such as data scientists, system architects, and artificial intelligence engineers.</p>
<p>In previous observations, we touched on how the various uses of artificial intelligence are streamlining tasks and paying dividends in the commercial sector. So, for example, in healthcare, AI applications are facilitating the management of medical records and other data, automating repetitive tasks, and thereby enabling cost and process efficiencies. Elsewhere, AI technology is providing a framework for digital and virtual consultations, precision medicine, and the creation of new drugs and treatment regimens.</p>
